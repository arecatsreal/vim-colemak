Colemak (http://colemak.com/) is a semi-QWERTY compatible keyboard layout. A major hurdle in switching to the colemak layout is still
using vim. Some minor functionality is lost but the most important functionality is present with minimal change to the VIM usage. Most
keys are set in a location such that muscle memory, rather than key letter, will cause the right action in VIM. For example the right
hand still navigates and selects lines as folks will be used to. The most essential change is that insert mode is now entered using the
'm' stroke, as the 'i' stroke is on the home row right hand, which one needs for navigation. This is less of an impact on the VIM usage
experience than switching to left hand navigation, which is another common alternative for colemak vim users.
